The dashboard offers an interactive study of mortality statistics for homicide, firearm-related fatalities, and drug overdoses in the United States. It is aimed as a tool for analysing the changes and patterns of death rates across states and across time. The primary narrative that the dashboard aims to portray is the temporal and geographical variance in the death rates linked to these three categories. To see how these variables differ between states, users may choose a particular year, mortality category (firearm, homicide, drugs overdose), and information type (mortality rate or fatality count). The state-by-state visual representation of the chosen mortality statistics, provided by the choropleth map, provides information on areas with greater or fewer instances of death. Furthermore, the dashboard offers state rankings according to the chosen criteria, enabling users to determine the states that have the greatest or lowest death counts or mortality rates for a specific year and category. This feature makes it easier to compare and comprehend how different states' mortality results differ from one another. Additionally, the use of bar charts improves the study by giving users a more thorough perspective on the chosen mortality statistics and enabling them to compare various states within a given year and fatality category. The dashboard's overall goal is to provide users with the ability to investigate and evaluate death patterns in the United States, enabling them to make well-informed decisions and perhaps influencing public health initiatives meant to lower the death rates connected to drug overdoses, homicides, and firearm-related occurrences.

The dashboard makes use of three main datasets that are obtained from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): data on drug overdose deaths, data on firearm-related deaths, and data on murder deaths. These databases contain vital information for comprehending public health issues associated with violent crime and drug usage, as well as critical insights into the numerous causes of death in the United States. Information on fatalities brought on by the deliberate killing of another person is included in the homicide mortality dataset, which sheds light on the frequency and distribution of violent crime over time and throughout several states. It provides important background for comprehending the effects of interpersonal violence on society and the efficacy of programmes meant to lower the rate of homicide.The firearm-related fatality dataset exclusively records firearm-related deaths, such as suicides, murders, and accidents. This dataset allows for a more focused examination of the effects of weapons on the safety and health of the public by separating out firearm-related fatalities. For legislators and public health authorities attempting to address concerns about gun violence and gun control, it offers vital information. The drug overdose fatality dataset includes fatalities brought on by drug abuse or misuse, encompassing both illegal and prescription drug usage. The opioid crisis and other drug misuse problems afflicting American communities are clarified by this dataset.

A number of important factors have been taken into account while creating the layers of the dashboard, which include bar charts and choropleth maps, in order to provide an understandable and educational user experience. First off, the main visualisation technique chosen was choropleth maps, which effectively portray geographical trends in data on mortality across different states. Users may rapidly identify locations with different rates of fatality by using colour gradients, which are used in choreopleth maps to indicate differences in rates of mortality or death counts. Warmer colours generally indicate larger rates or counts, whereas cooler colours reflect lower values. The colour palette was thoughtfully chosen to promote clarity and interpretability. Geopandas facilitated the manipulation of geospatial data, while Folium enabled the creation of interactive leaflet maps with choropleth layers and clustered markers. Plotly Express was utilized for generating interactive bar charts with mean average lines. Panel provided the framework for building interactive dashboards, incorporating widgets for selecting options and updating visualizations dynamically. The dashboard also consists 2 inclusive layers a region layer and a satelite layer which improves aesthethics as well as help correllate statistics with regions and geography. Additionally, by offering a more detailed picture of the chosen mortality statistics, the use of bar charts enhances the choropleth maps. Bar charts make it easier for users to spot patterns and outliers by providing a state-by-state comparison of death rates or counts within a given year and mortality category. Users may easily compare states and check specific values by hovering over individual bars in the interactive bar charts. Moreover the layer showcasing markers for each state is present which showcases the relavant data and state name upon hovering. Overall, the design decisions made for the layers that are displayed place a high priority on usability, clarity, and interactivity. This makes it possible for users to effectively explore and analyse the mortality data to learn important information about public health issues and trends in the US.

The dashboard's interactive design decisions were thoughtfully considered in order to improve user engagement, make it easier for users to explore the data, and allow for insightful study of mortality patterns in the US. Zooming and panning are two examples of cartographic features that were added to provide viewers more control of their viewing experience along with zooming additional interactivity surrounding clusters among markers is utilized for better interactivity. Users can analyse mortality statistics at different levels of granularity and concentrate on certain regions or regions of interest by zooming in and out of the maps of choropleth. In a similar vein, users may investigate mortality patterns across the United States by navigating around the map using the panning capability. The markers when hovered showcase the data for the datasets along with thee state name which can be corellated with the chloropeth and the addition widgets surrounding ranking tables and bar graphs. Furthermore, interactive widgets were used to allow users to personalise their analysis and view the data in a way that suits their tastes. Users may customise the visualisation to their research topics or areas of interest by using dropdown menus to pick certain years, mortality types (such as homicide, firearm-related fatalities, drug overdose), and data types (such as mortality rate, death count). By allowing users to visualise the bar chart there is an enhance in interactivity and provides a more concentrated investigation of mortality patterns. Additionally, event handlers were carefully used to make sure that user interactions caused the visualisations to change dynamically. The choropleth maps, ranks, and bar charts dynamically adapt to reflect the selected parameters as users pick different options from the dropdown menus or radio buttons. This allows for smooth data exploration and real-time feedback. In general, the design decisions pertaining to interactivity are made with the intention of producing an intuitive and user-friendly interface that will enable people to engage with the data, get knowledge, and decide on public health interventions and policy efforts.
